 1. Eat breakfast: A protein and healthy fat breakfast can keep you full for longer and help prevent snacking during the day.

 2. Remember your five-a-day: Fruits and vegetables can be a tasty snack and they can bulk out your meals. They are high in
    nutrients and fiber and low in calories and fat.

 3. Eat slow-burning calories: High-fiber carbohydrates, such as legumes, and healthy fats, such as avocado, take longer to
    release energy, so you will not get hungry as quickly.

 4. Exercise: This can help burn off extra calories, and it can make you feel good. A brisk daily walk is easy for most 
    people to do and costs nothing. Challenge yourself with a pedometer.

 5. Drink water: It is healthful, has no calories, and can fill you up. Avoid alcohol and sodas as these can easily provide
    far too many calories. If you crave sweet drinks, choose unsweetened fruit juices, or better still, get a juice maker.
  
 6. Slow down: Eat slowly and rest between courses or extra servings, as it can take 20 to 30 minutes for your body to
    realize it feels full.

 7. A little of what you fancy: Banning foods can lead to cravings and bingeing. Spoil yourself occasionally with a favorite
    treat, but in smaller amounts.

 8. Get enough sleep: Sleep loss affects the metabolism, and it has been linked to weight gain.

 9. Avoid eating 2 hours before bed: Eating within 2 hours of sleeping can interfere with sleep quality and promote weight gain.
